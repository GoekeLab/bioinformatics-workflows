## About Galaxy
Galaxy is a web-based platform to develeop and execute bioinformatics workflows. Galaxy has extensive online documentation, a good place to get started is the [Galaxy 101](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html)

## Training material and documentation

- [documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/)

## Community-developed workflows in Galaxy

Most workflows can be found on one of the large Galaxy instances:

- [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/workflows/list_published)
- [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list_published)
- [usegalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au/workflows/list_published)
- [usegalaxy.be](https://usegalaxy.be/workflows/list_published)
- [usegalaxy.fr](https://usegalaxy.fr/workflows/list_published)

A newer initiative exists that publishes best-practice production workflows to [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc) and [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows?filter%5Bproject%5D=33&filter%5Bworkflow_type%5D=galaxy) to facilitate Workflow discovery across different Galaxy instances.

## Running the minimal proof-of-concept RNA-Seq Galaxy pipeline

1. Register or login to your account on any Galaxy server, e.g [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org)
2. Open the [proof of concept workflow on dockstore](https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/mvdbeek/bioinformatics-workflows/salmon-proof-of-concept-galaxy:master?tab=info)
3. Click on the "Launch with Galaxy" button and select a Galaxy server.
4. Click on the workflow version you would like to import
5. Click on the "Run Workflow" button
6. Upload or provide a URL to the input data and run the pipeline using the GUI. Further details on uploading files [here](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/upload/)

## Notes and Contribution
This pipeline is a minimal example of using Galaxy. We welcome contributions to the documentation and workflow, please create an issue or submit a pull request!
