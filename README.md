# bioinformatics-workflows

## Introduction
These pipelines are intended as a proof-of-concept demonstrate the distinctions between bioinformatics workflow managers.
The analysis workflow used for the proof-of-concept is a small portion of an RNA-seq workflow, using the tool `salmon` for transcriptome alignment and quantification and `fastqc` for quality control.


## Documentation
To install and run a pipeline you can clone this Github repository to your local machine, navigate to the corresponding folder for the desired workflow manager implementation and follow the documentation there.
